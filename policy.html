          The consequences of extreme wildfires are being felt worldwide. Extreme events of the 2024-25 fire season brought fatalities 
          across Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, mass evacuations and record-breaking economic damage in Los Angeles, hazardous 
          air pollution in Brazil, Bolivia, India, and California, and vast greenhouse gas emissions from carbon-rich forests in South 
          America and Canada. The path to avoiding these consequences is clear: reduce global emissions rapidly, strengthen fire governance, 
          and invest in adaptation to build resilience now. The State of Wildfires Report, published in Earth System Science Data, is our 
          second annual global assessment of extreme wildfire events. It documents when and where extreme wildfires events occurred, their 
          impacts, why they happened, and the role of climate change. The project unites world-leading experts from more than 60 institutes 
          across 20 countries.

          Wildfires are becoming more intense and more frequent, ravaging communities and ecosystems 
          in their path. Recent years have seen record-breaking wildfire seasons across the world 
          from Australia to the Arctic to North and South America. With global temperatures on the 
          rise, the need to reduce wildfire risk is more critical than ever. A new report, Spreading 
          like Wildfire: The Rising Threat of Extraordinary Landscape Fires, by UNEP and GRID-Arendal, 
          finds that climate change and land-use change are making wildfires worse and anticipates a 
          global increase of extreme fires even in areas previously unaffected. Uncontrollable and 
          extreme wildfires can be devastating to people, biodiversity and ecosystems. They also 
          exacerbate climate change, contributing significant greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. UNEP 
          is issuing an urgent call to governments to rethink their approach to extreme wildfires. By 
          calling for a new "Fire Ready Formula" and recognizing the important role of ecosystem 
          restoration, we can minimize the risk of extreme wildfires by being better prepared and 
          building back better in their aftermath.

          The Ocean Conference, co-hosted by the Governments of Kenya and Portugal, came at a 
          critical time as the world is seeking to address many of the deep-rooted problems of 
          our societies laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic and which will require major structural 
          transformations and common shared solutions that are anchored in the SDGs. To mobilize 
          action, the Conference sought to propel much needed science-based innovative solutions 
          aimed at starting a new chapter of global ocean action.
